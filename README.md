RMIT - SWITCH x CSIT Hackathon

# Project Name
CultureConnect

## Description
Tackling issues with international students, and obstacles with accommodation and culture shock.
Created a web app that serves a platform to connect domestic students and international students. 

Think of it like the domestic students are the host family for the international student. That way they have accommodation and are immersed within the Australian culture through their "Australian family".
