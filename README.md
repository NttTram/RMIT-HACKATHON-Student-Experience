RMIT - SWITCH x CSIT Hackathon

# Project Name
CultureConnect

## Description
Tackling issues with international students, and obstacles with accommodation and culture shock.
Created a web app that serves a platform to connect domestic students and international students. 

Think of it like the domestic students are the host family for the international student. That way they have accommodation and are immersed within the Australian culture through their "Australian family".

## Installation
* Install node.js

## Usage
Run both on separate terminals.

### Frontend
* In terminal: cd my-app, npm install, npm start
* In terminal: cd my-app, npm install @auth0/auth0-react

### Backend
* In terminal: cd backend, npm install, node server.js

  




## Developmental Solutions: B4
Please clearly mark the generalised solutions in the repository README section.

### Scenario 1: Just Host Home
Kim, a local student, logs into the web app and goes to Just Host Home. She clicks "Create Listing," fills out her home details—location, photos, and availability—and submits.

Soon after, Sarah receives a request from an international student interested in staying. They chat through the app’s messaging system, confirm the stay, and Sarah is ready to host, helping a new student settle in while sharing her culture.

### Scenario 2: Find Home
Austin, an international student, visits the web app to find accommodation. He navigates to Find Home, filters for places near his university, and spots a listing that matches his needs.

Alex logs in, submits a request to the host, and introduces himself. The host responds, and they finalize the stay details through the chat. Alex feels prepared for his upcoming move, knowing he'll stay with a fellow student who can help him adjust.
