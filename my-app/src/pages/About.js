        <h2>About CultureConnect</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to CultureConnect, an innovative initiative by SEASA designed
          to enhance the experience of international students at RMIT
          University. Our mission is to create a supportive and inclusive
          community where students from around the world can feel at home in
          Melbourne.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          At CultureConnect, we envision a world where every international
          student feels welcomed, supported, and connected. We aim to bridge the
          gap between domestic and international students, fostering friendships
          and cultural exchange that enrich the lives of all participants.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          CultureConnect is a web platform that connects international students
          with domestic students who act as hosts. This unique arrangement
          provides international students with comfortable accommodation and an
          immersive cultural experience. By living with a local student of
          similar age, international students can navigate their new environment
          with ease and confidence.
        </p>
